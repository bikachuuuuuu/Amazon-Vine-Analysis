As we can see, there is a drastic difference between the two. There are thousands of reviews that are outside of the Vine program, and less than 100 for the Vine program.

Next, let us investigate how many of the Vine reviews were 5 stars, versus how many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

We can see that there are still thousands of reviews for those outside the Vine program, and fewer for the Vine program.

With this data provided, we calculated the percentages of how many Vine reviews were 5 stars, and how many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.
